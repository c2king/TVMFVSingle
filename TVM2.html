        <h1>Future Value of a Single Sum Game</h1>
        <div id="intro">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The future value of a single sum is a fundamental concept in finance that calculates the value of a current asset at a specific future date, based on an assumed growth rate. Understanding this concept is crucial for business students because:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>It forms the basis for many financial decisions, including investments and savings strategies.</li>
                <li>It demonstrates the time value of money principle.</li>
                <li>It helps in comparing different investment options.</li>
                <li>It's essential for retirement planning and long-term financial goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The future value formula is: FV = PV * (1 + r)^t, where FV is future value, PV is present value, r is the interest rate, and t is the number of periods.</p>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>1. Click "Start Game" to begin.</p>
            <p>2. You will be presented with 10 random questions about the future value of a single sum.</p>
            <p>3. Select the best answer from the four options provided.</p>
            <p>4. If you answer incorrectly, you'll have another chance to select the right answer.</p>
            <p>5. Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate between questions.</p>
            <p>6. Your progress will be shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>
            <p>Good luck!</p>
